      <h2 className="text-2xl tracking-wider">Project Expectations</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      We remember finishing last semester eager to know what Project III was all about. We were told it was the most important subject of the degree, that 
      it would be our star project to show in our curriculums once we enter the industry to look for a job. We were constantly asking our teachers for 
      hints on what the theme would be this year, or who were going to be the leads selected, basically, asking for anything they could tell us in advance 
      to satiate our curiosity. For many of us, this project was the main topic that we would chatter about since we were so excited for February to come 
      and get started with it.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      Overall and without a doubt, we are a class that is very hardworking and we are lucky to get along with each other very well. We started with the right 
      foot, everyone was extremely motivated and excited to make the project a game that we would be proud of calling our own. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      The first class of the new semester was all about the teachers introducing the topic and game genre that we would be working on, as well as what the 
      resultant team was, since everyone had to apply for different roles in the project. Our teachers explained to us that we would be doing an RTT game 
      based on the classic game Commandos, a stealth-oriented real-time tactics video game from 1998, and with Dune theme, one of the world’s best-selling 
      science fiction novels, set in a distant future feudal interstellar society. Most of us agreed that the topic of this year was not the most exciting 
      one, but either way, we were ready to start making our staple in CITM, because we wanted to make one of the best games produced in the university.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl tracking-wider ">Progression</h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600 ">Beginning</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      We started off strong, as motivated as we could ever be, everyone in the team was ready to sacrifice all their free-time to put those hours into 
      the project. We aimed high while still being ready to cut off if it was necessary, which, at the end, it was.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      From the department of programming we had some difficulties since the outcome of last semester’s class, Game Engines, was disastrous. The idea of 
      this subject is to make our own game with the engine we built last semester in Game Engines, but we had very bad results in that class, which 
      directly affected Project III. We had to redo many modules within the engine, which took a very long time to do, as well as effort. The department 
      had to, logically, prioritize finishing the engine before we could do anything related to the gameplay, which negatively impacted the production 
      of the game, delaying and slowing the production.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      From the department of design, they aimed as high as they could, exploring all the different alternatives and elements that could be implemented, 
      from mechanics to the storyline of the game. Luckily, we had a chat with the leads from the project last year, and they told us that most of the 
      design decisions, due to lack of time, would probably not make it into the game. With this information in mind, we planned out different packs. 
      These packs were different sets of design elements that would be in the game depending on how our progression with the programming team was going, 
      and if we had the time and resources to implement them. This was one of the best decisions we could have made at the beginning, because it prepared 
      us for what the project was going to bring us.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      As for art, their mission was to explore and discover which artistic path they would take in order to give life to the game. The idea of having one 
      lead and four artists was a little scary at first. It was such a small team that would have to cover all the visuals for the game, including the models, 
      the animations, the texturing, the UI, the sounds and music, etc. It was for sure a challenge to produce all of this with such a small team, but with a 
      good organization and the role each artist took (one for environment, two for characters and enemies, and another one for UI and sounds), they were able 
      to produce everything as efficiently as they could. So, this start was strong, where they produced the Art Bible that would be their guide for the upcoming 
      months, and which they had to stick to in order to produce cohesive, and stunning, visuals and audio.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      Finally, for the production team, it was a bit of a confusing start. We didn’t have the experience of leading a team, and the role of the producer sounded 
      a bit abstract at first since we never learned anything about it. It was a challenging start where we would have to figure out what kind of planification 
      worked out the best for us, but once we understood it, the producer was able to plan out the methodology that we would follow in the upcoming months in 
      order to make the game as efficiently as we could. She came up with our production plan, and presented it to the class. This gave clarification on how 
      the team would work, covering the meetings that would need to take place as well as the different organizational tools we would use to keep track of the 
      project’s progression.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600 ">Middle</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      Weeks went by and it looked from the outside that we were making little to no progress since we had very little to show of the game. Due to the initial 
      state of the engine, we put most of our resources into that. It was necessary to finish the engine. Luckily enough, our programming teacher Toni, knew 
      and understood our situation. At the end of the day, he was our teacher last semester for Game Engines, so he knew from what base we were starting off 
      and what it meant to make basically a whole engine and a game in four months. He was very understanding and always supported the decisions we were making. 
      We started dividing the coding team in two sections, one in charge of the motor and the other of the gameplay. We couldn’t let all the gameplay towards 
      the very end or it would be disastrous. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      As for design, we started realizing that we did not have a stable engine where we could playtest, so we took the right decision to imitate the game into 
      Unity. Two designers took the responsibility of programming it, and we have to say that it helped a lot to have this platform where we could start 
      visualizing what our game would look like. 

      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      From the art department, it was constant work from all the sub-departments in the team (characters, enemies, environment, UI and sound). We had some issues 
      trying to figure out how to export specific models or animations to our engine, but after a lot of trial and error, we got it.  
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      For design and art it was easier to track the progress of the development of the project, since design had its GDD and art had their assets pack. 
      We had something to show our art and design teachers, but they were right in insisting that it was time to see the progress in our game. We tried 
      very hard but we had the bottleneck of the engine. 
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600">End</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      Around the beginning of May, one month before the delivery of  the project, we were finally freed from the bottleneck of the engine. It took a lot 
      of effort and time to make this happen, but it did thanks to our programming team. Once this happened, everything started running more smoothly. 
      They had the chance to focus on gameplay and include the part of design and art into the game. We could start to see that what we were putting so 
      many hours and effort to do was starting to take shape. We know that it got delayed too much, but at the same time, there was really nothing we 
      could have done to change the state of the engine. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      The project was reaching the end, and everyone was putting so much hard work into it. The amount of hours spent on it was crazy, but the progress 
      is there. We were congratulated by our teachers once we got freed from the engine problem, which helped us a lot by boosting our motivation a bit more. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      We had some issues with the team motivation at certain points of the end of the project. There were some misunderstandings as well as some tension in 
      the team, but, being a group of 25 students making such a huge project, we guess it’s inevitable. As a team, we fixed these issues and looked 
      forward to finishing the game as best as we could.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl tracking-wider">Project Expectations</h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600">The Team</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      When we think about what went well in the project, the first thing that comes to mind is the team. Not only the bond we created as a class but as well 
      as the implication everyone had to the project. We learned how to work together, listen to each other, and most importantly, understand and help each 
      other. Yes, there were a couple of times when there was some tension, but we managed to solve it and learn from it. The bond we built not only helped 
      for better communication, but also to improve and lift the motivation of the team. We shared a common goal and we worked together to reach it.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600">The Implication</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      Project III is a very demanding subject, which requires many hours and therefore implication from everybody. Everyone found time to put into this project, 
      even when it seemed impossible. We all had exams and projects coming from other subjects, and some even had work outside university, nevertheless, that did not stop us.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      We have to give a big shoutout to the programming team, which did the impossible. All the departments managed to deliver their part and unify them into what 
      is Dune Special Spice Ops.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600 ">The Management</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      Even with no experience of managing a team, overall, we are very proud of ourselves for being able to bring the team together and plan out the project. 
      From organizing the tasks everyone had to do weekly, to general milestone objectives, our work as leads and producer helped give our game a sense 
      of direction and progression.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      Managing a team is not only directing the tasks that needed to be done, but understanding their position, their strengths and weaknesses, and their 
      implication in order to make the right decisions for the best result. 
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl tracking-wider ">What Can Be Improved</h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600">The Knowledge</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      Overall, we can say from the different departments that we lacked experience and knowledge of how to make an AAA game in four months. The 
      programmers feel like they didn’t have the base on C++ that they needed, as well as knowledge on engine OpenGL, and in-depth understanding 
      on the different modules and how to unify them into an engine. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      For designers, they had little to no knowledge on how to design an RTT game, so they had to do a lot of research on it and look for a lot of references to base our project on. 

      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      For artists, we learned in uni how to model, animate and texturize, but we never learned how to export everything for our engine. That was one of the challenges we had to face and overcome. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      For the direction team, we never had the experience of managing so many people and the emotional implication it has, since we had to take so many important decisions all along the project. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      Finally, for the producer, we have never learned anything about the role, how important it is to have a project manager and a figure of leadership.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      We expected, logically, that we had to learn a lot about how to make this project, but some extra help, indications and preparation would have helped us be more prepared for the responsibilities each and every one of us had to take.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600">The Engine</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      As mentioned before, we had a very bad start due to the base we had from Game Engines. We did not have a good start off point to make the engine, 
      so our programming team had to put a lot of resources into fixing and redoing most of the modules that make up Ko-Fi engine today.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600 ">The Team’s Effort Into Production</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      Different tools were given to the team in order to track their progression on the tasks, like HacknPlan, the hour log, the scrum teams, etc. 
      For some team members, the importance of these tools to ensure a good workflow wasn’t clear, even if the leads and producer insisted daily that 
      they needed to be used. Many people forgot to update their tasks or log their hours. In addition, we worked most sprints in scrum teams. Generally, 
      scrum masters should have put more implication in their role to ensure good communication in their scrum team. The direction team could have put 
      more emphasis on working as scrum teams, be more insistent with their responsibilities. Every week we did scrum team's retrospective, and it mostly 
      seemed like a waste of time, because they were not really taken seriously.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl tracking-wider">Conclusions</h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600">The Subject</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500">
      In general, we believe the structure of our university with this subject and this semester is not very well designed for students. The amount of time 
      that has to be put into this project in order to make the result possible is insane, and it seems that they do not take into account that we have other 
      four subjects as well as a personal life besides university.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      No matter how hard we tried, or how much work and hours we put into the project, we constantly felt like the requirements for the subject were 
      unrealistic. Building a whole engine and game in four months is very demanding, and pretty unrealistic, and sometimes we felt like we didn’t 
      have enough support from the university, in terms of feedback and overall implication.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl tracking-wider text-gray-600">The Result</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      After months of hard work we can finally say that we are done! It has been a rollercoaster of emotions at some points.
       We were overall motivated, but it got to a point of overwhelming stress and pressure to deliver the product. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      After talking to the rest of the team and gathering some feedback, we all agree that there are specific things we 
      could have done better, and not only what was mentioned before, such as making priority lists since the beginning 
      (we only started doing it after the Alpha 2), or better limiting what was design and what was art when making characters.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      Now, seeing it from an outside perspective, we can say that we are very proud of the work we have done, and we did a very 
      good job in overcoming all the challenges and obstacles that crossed our path. Yes, there are things that we could have 
      done better, but it is part of the learning process to make mistakes as long as we take them into account in future projects.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">
      The game ended up not reaching our expectations design-wise. We would have hoped for a bit more time or a stronger base to 
      start off the project from. Sometimes we dream about how well the game would have turned out if we didn’t have the bottleneck 
      of the engine, or if we had done it in Unity, for example. But at the same time, doing it all by ourselves gives it more value 
      and makes it more personal. Project III helped us learn a lot, gave us the experience of working in a big team, as well as bringing us closer together.
