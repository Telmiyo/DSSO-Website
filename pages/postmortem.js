      We remember finishing last semester eager to know what Project III was all about. We were told it was the most important subject of the degree, 
      that it would be our star project to show in our curriculums once we enter the industry to look for a job. We were constantly asking our teachers 
      for hints on what the theme would be this year, or who were going to be the leads selected, basically, asking for anything they could tell us in 
      advance to satiate our curiosity. For many of us, this project was the main topic that we would chatter about since we were so excited for February
       to come and get started with it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-2">
      Overall and without a doubt, we are a class that is very hardworking and we are lucky to get along with each other very well. We started with the right foot, 
      everyone was extremely motivated and excited to make the project a game that we would be proud of calling our own.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-2">
      The first class of the new semester was all about the teachers introducing the topic and game genre that we would be working on, 
      +as well as what was the resultant team was, since everyone had to apply for different roles in the project. Our teachers explained 
      to us that we would be doing an RTT game based on the classic game Commandos, a stealth-oriented real-time tactics video game from 1998,
       and with Dune theme, one of the world’s best-selling science fiction novels, set in a distant future feudal interstellar society. 
       Most of us agreed that the topic of this year was not the most exciting one, but either way, we were ready to start making our staple in CITM, 
       because we wanted to make one of the best games produced in the university.

      <h2 className="text-xl tracking-wider mt-8">Progression</h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg tracking-wider text-gray-600 mt-2">Beginning</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-2">
      We started off strong, as motivated as we could ever be, everyone in the team was ready to sacrifice all their free-time to put those hours into the project.
       We aimed high while still being ready to cut off if it was necessary, which, at the end, had to be.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-2">
      From the department of programming we had some difficulties since the outcome of last semester’s class, Game Engines, was disastrous. The idea of this 
      subject is to make our own game with the engine we built last semester in Game Engines, but we had very bad results in that class, which directly affected 
      Project III. We had to redo many modules inside the engine, which took a very long time to do, as well as effort. The department had to, logically, 
      prioritize finishing the engine before we could do anything related to the gameplay, which negatively impacted the production of the game, 
      delaying and slowing the production.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-2">
      From the department of design, they aimed as high as they could, exploring all the different alternatives and elements that could be implemented, 
      from mechanics to the storyline of the game. Luckily, we had a chat with the leads from the project last year, and they told us that most of the design 
      decisions, due to lack of time, would probably not make it into the game. With this information in mind, we planned out different packs. 
      These packs were different sets of design elements that would be in the game depending on how our progression with the programming team was going, 
      and if we had the time and resources to implement them. This was one of the best decisions we could have made in the beginning, because it prepared 
      us for what the project was going to bring us.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-2">
      As for art, their mission was to explore and discover which artistic path they would take in order to give life to the game. 
      The idea of having one lead and four artists was a little scary at first. It was such a small team that would have to cover 
      all the visuals for the game, including the models, the animations, the texturing, the UI, the sounds and music, etc. It was for 
      sure a challenge to produce all of this with such a small team, but with a good organization and the role each artist took 
      (one for environment, two for characters and enemies, and another one for UI and sounds), they were able to produce everything as 
      efficiently as they could. So, this start was strong, where they produced the Art Bible that would be their guide for the upcoming months, 
      and which they had to stick to in order to produce cohesive and stunning visuals.

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-2">
      Finally, for the production team, it was a bit of a confusing start. We didn’t have the experience of leading a team, 
      and the role of the producer sounded a bit abstract at first since we never learned anything about it. It was a challenging 
      start where we would have to figure out what kind of planification worked out the best for us, but once we understood it,
       the producer was able to plan out the methodology that we would follow in the upcoming months in order to make the game as 
       efficiently as we could. She came up with our production plan, and presented it to the class. This gave clarification on how the team would work, 
       covering the meetings that would need to take place as well as the different organizational tools that we would use to keep track of the project’s 
       progression.

      Weeks went by and it looked from the outside that we were doing little to no progress since we had very little to show of the game. 
      Due to the initial status of the engine, we put most of our resources into that. It was necessary to finish the engine. Luckily enough, 
      our programming teacher Toni, knew and understood our situation. At the end of the day, he was our teacher last semester for Game Engines, 
      so he knew from what base we were starting off and what it meant to make basically a whole engine and a game in four months. He was very understanding 
      and always supported the decisions we were making. We started dividing the team in two sections, one in charge of the motor and the other of the gameplay. We couldn’t let all the gameplay towards the very end or it would be disastrous.
