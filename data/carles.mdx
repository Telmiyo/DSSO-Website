      ## About Me
        Since I was a child, my passion has been the computers and everything that relates them, until
        one day I discovered concept of video game. Since that day I have been playing a wide quantity
        of games, allowing me to want to discover how they are made. The first touch with the
        development of games was in 2011, when I downloaded a version of Blender, being able to model simple
        objects, but leaving it due to the pc I was working with broke and it was impossible for me until
        2018, where I could get my first pc only for me. I still used Blender for help me to study technical
        drawing in high school. The next step for me started when I discovered an application to modify gba roms
        from Pokémon video games, allowing me to learn a bit more about how these games can be made.
        
        The most crucial moment of my life arrived when I had to pick university and choose my path to the
        professional world and I found the degree of Video Game Development and Design at CITM UPC, being
        a gold opportunity. When I started this degree I was very lost in which path I would choose, due to
        it was a bigger world than I thought, but somehow the subjects related with art and design called me
        the atention, so I was doubting about that many times. Some subjects that awoke my creative level were
        Game Design I and II, 3D environments and 3D modelling.
        
        Finally, when Project III was about to start, I had to choose one path and focus on it, so after two 
        days of meditation I finally decided to the art team, giving me lot of experience and awaking inside of 
        me the will to learn more. My focus in this project has been the environments, due to neither animations nor
        characters are my strongest points, and I have always liked the environments of the video games and the way they are 
        made.

      ## Hard Skills
        As an environment artist for this project I have focused more on the generation of 3D models and
        environment props with the usage of 2D and 3D software, including:
        - Blender
        - Maya
        - 3DStudio Max
        - Adobe Substance 3D Painter
        - Adobe Photoshop
      
      <br/>

      ## Soft Skills
        - Creativity
        - Cooperation
        - Flexibility
      
      <br/>

      ## Experience

        Despite I didn't have the opportunity to work in a video game company, I have been working in different 
        places.

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        For this project, I had the role of environment artist, creating the props that will form part of the
        levels inside the game.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Props creation</u>
          I have been in charge of the creation of the props displayed in the environments of the levels, making them
          attractive in a visual way and that correlate with the history and lore. Here there are some examples and
          the results.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Creation of a character</u>
          I have also in charge of creating the enemy unit of the "Mentat", but having time issues it has been discarded.
