description: "Hi! My name is María Calle and I am the lead Designer of this project. These three months have been a very enriching experience that
has allowed me to understand bit better the magnitude of designing a game start to finish, as well as what it truly means to manage a team. 
<br/> 
It has been a wonderful ride and I am happy I have had the chance to work with people who are just as passionate about the project as I am."

      ## About Me
        This degree, Video Game Design and Developement, explores all aspects of creating video games, 
        and it has taught me many valuable skills. Among them are coding and programming, 
        which go alongside with logical thinking and problem solving skills.
        Artistically it has pushed me to learn new ways of creating art since 
        I was a strictly traditional artist before. It has trained me to be
        more vocal about my opinions but still open minded and understanding of 
        others by heavily promoting teamwork. This has given me a very valuable
        feel of how working in this industry feels like.<br/>
        
        The single most important thing it has showed me, tough, is what I want to be. 
        I started out being primarily interested in programming, 
        but that didn't last very long after I started modelling. I absolutely loved these subjects but, not really knowing why, 
        I always leaned towards modelling environments almost exclusively, trying to tell stories with them.
        It finally clicked when I came across the Game Design subject:
        what I truly love is creating exciting and interesting worlds that people can experience and interact with.
        This includes the history of the world, its people, the story that is developing around it and, above all, 
        the way I allow players to interact while having fun and growing throughout: the mechanics and the progression.
        
        > We don't create a fantasy world to escape reality. We create it to be able to stay.
        <br/>- Lynda Barry

        What better medium for this goal than video games.

        Today, I aspire to be a game designer while maintaining my skills as a 3D artist.

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        For this project I was selected as lead designer. My role has primarily been to organize the development and the workload.
        This includes keeping a tight communication with the rest of the production team, specially with the lead programmer, 
        since the technical aspectsof the engine greatly impacted what we could and we couldn't do. I have also participated in the actual design process, as well as
        giving feedback to my teamvision of what the game could be.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Research</u>
          For the Concept Discovery phase, the whole team researched about everything related to the product. 
          We researched about the theme, we explored universe of Dune and watched the movies as well the games that had been released in connection to the franchise.
          Design wise we analyzed the RTT genre and similar ones like RTS.

        ### <u>Interface Design</u>
          At some point in the development it was needed for the Use Interface to be reworked, and, along with Alex Ávila, we ended up designing a new one.
          We followed a process that consisted on creating small pieces first (colors, fontk, backgrounds, etc.) and combining them to give shape to the UI in a very consistent way.

        ### <u>General Design</u>
          I contributed in the creation process of the game, just like the rest of the team, since it was an overall colaborative project, even if there were some specialized fields one
          of the team members was in charge of.

        ### <u>Design decisions</u>
          As lead, one of my jobs is to make sure that the design decisions are up to the level that, in my opinion, project intended to offer. 
          Therefore I had to step in and make decisions regarding the time, the coding department, the available resources, etc.

        ### <u>Evaluation</u>
          As lead of my department I had to give feedback to my team about the quality tasks they were doing, the level of effort they were putting in, etc, and this feedback+
          was given in the shape of weekly grades that the teachers would later have in consideration.


      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Lead meetings</u>
          I have been in charge of supervising and communicating with my team via daily meetings. 

        ### <u>Workload Organizaiton</u>
        Throughout the project, the production team has been dividing the workload in tasks, which I assigned every two weeks and kept track of them.
