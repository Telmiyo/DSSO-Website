      ## About Me
       I've always been a curious person, and if I saw that I could do something that I liked, 
       I'd try to do it, as I did when I was 12 years old and started configuring my first minecraft 
       plugins to be able to make online servers. From there, I became interested in the code and I followed 
       small unity tutorials; it was clear to me that video game programming was what I wanted to study. 
       After many years and having begun my studies, I became interested in web development, marketing, 
       and product sales, which led me down another path. Nowadays, I have it clear that I am passionate about 
       video game programming, but I also like to cover more areas and learn from them.

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        In this project, I had the role of programmer. Mainly because I enjoy programming,
         it has been a challenge for me, and I have enjoyed it because I have improved significantly 
         in my field, and seeing the results to which I have contributed has been gratifying.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Guizmo</u>
          I put the gizmo of the objects on stage into action. It was a quite annoying process because it 
          had to be tailored to the limitations of the transform component.
        ### <u>Mouse Picking</u>
          I was in charge of implementing mouse picking of objects in the scene to make it easier to interact with them.
        ### <u>Camera Rework</u>
          The camera is a critical component in a game engine, and the camera code we had in the engine, 
          both the engine camera and the camera component, was causing us a lot of problems. As a result, 
          I took it upon myself to reimplement and improve the entire camera. It was a somewhat complicated 
          process because many sections relied on the old camera's code, which I had to adapt. The result was
          great and we could add new features with [Alejandro Avila's](/alejandro) help.
        ### <u>Dialogues</u>
          Bla Bla Bla. Add as many as you need.
        ### <u>Engine Improvements </u>
          Bla Bla Bla. Add as many as you need.
        ### <u>Web Design & Developement </u>
          Bla Bla Bla. Add as many as you need.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u> Hierarchy Imporvements</u>
         Alex and I improved the object hierarchy in the scene so that you could reorganize them by dragging them. I also contributed by adding an alert box and implementation to enable / disable an the childrens of an object. 
        ### <u>Camera Movement</u>
          These tasks are less important. Remember, after a paragraph put <br/> to make an
          enter.
        ### <u>Space Partitioning</u>
          These tasks are less important. Remember, after a paragraph put <br/> to make an
          enter.
