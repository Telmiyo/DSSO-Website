      ## About Me
       Growing up, I discovered that stories were one of the only things I enjoyed experiencing, 
       be it books, movies or role playing games such as DnD, I always found myself immersed in the worlds and characters in them,
       hoping someday to take part in the creating of such amazing journeys.
      
       Getting out of high school without much of an idea of what to do, so I choose this industry
       solely due to liking video games and the creativity and liberty that comes with them,
       having nothing akin to a passion or dream to follow choosing something that I liked 
       seemed the overall correct option.

       In the end, I arrived to the conclusion that this industry has all the possibilities to help
       me create that kind of stories and during the years studying its insides I discovered how
       to design and develop those stories in one of my favourites mediums that is videogames.

      ## Project Overview
        As a designer I touched a lot of content with my teammates, at first designing them and them helping 
        develop and implement them in the engine as well as testing if what we created was working as was designed.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Engine Implementation</u>
          Adding elements into the game through the engine.

        ### <u>Level Design</u>
          Objectives and challenges (enemies, traps, obstacles) distribution in level 1 together 
          with [Eduard Minguell](/eduard). Also creating the first idea for a possible level 3 map layout, 
          redesigned and finished by [Eduard Minguell](/eduard) and [Arnau Lucena](/arnau).

        ### <u>Playtesting</u>
          Gameplay testing in Unity and in our engine, seeing everything works as intended, watching out 
          for balance issues, HUD and UI positioning and oveall game feel.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Blockout</u>
          Building a number of iterations of the first looks of the maps for levels 2-3, mainly working 
          in Blender passing into 3D what was designed in paper. Creating aproximations of props as well as 
          enemy and objectives positioning for the other departments to better grasp and streamline future 
          development.

        ### <u>Bug Catching</u>
          Going into the game and testing its limits to search for possible bugs to be reported.

        ### <u>Cutscene Nerala's Death</u>
          Creating the storyboard for the cutscene showing the death of Nerala's character.
