      ## About Me
        Ever since I was a child, I have had a great interest in technology and computers, but especially in video games. This was until I started to ask myself questions like, will it take a lot of effort to create a video game from scratch? Are there a lot of people developing them?
        That's how it started to create in me a motivation that led me to start this university career, Video Game Design and Development (after finishing a year in Computer Engineering...).

        It has been about 5 years since I started programming and I will continue without losing the motivation to learn more and more languages. 
        In Project III, apart from developing new coding methods and techniques in C++, it has been possible to learn a new language that we have used for the scripts of the videogame Dune SSO, this is Lua.
      <br/>
      ## Hard Skills
        Thanks to this project, I have been able to develop programming methodologies and learn new languages that help personal development. The following points are the fields investigated:
        - C++
        - Lua
        - Git
        - Videogame's engine development
        - Gameplay programming
      <br/>
      ## Soft Skills
        In terms of personal attitudes I have managed to develop the following traits:
        - Team-working
        - Motivation
        - Persistance
        - Overcoming
      <br/>
      ## Experience

On the first months, I've been learning the languages and framework they work with. In this case, mainly PHP, HTML, CSS combined with Codeigniter framework."/>

      ## Project Overview
      In Project III, I have been assigned the general role of Programmer. In this sector I have been entrusted with many different tasks, from the implementation of physics in an engine, to elements of Gameplay or HUD improvement.
      Also, something I'm proud of, is that I've been able to help and support all my teammates who have needed help at some point, or simply to solve some problem. 
      I think it's thanks to this that I've been able to realise the field where I'm best suited as a programmer, and where I'd like to work in the future.
      <br/>
      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Physics</u>
          Implementing physics in KoFi Engine was one of the first big tasks I was given. 
          I started to do it with the PhysX physics engine, but it was a bit too big for me and we decided, with the help of [Alex Ávila](/alex), to implement a lighter library called ReactPhysics3D.
          <br/>
        ### <u>Gameplay</u>
          I was able to join to help my partner [Tomás Carreras](/tomas), to polish and add new features to the gameplay of Dune SSO. That's how it has continued until the end of the project.
          I really enjoyed working both on the gameplay and with my partner Tomás, I think we did a good job.
          <br/>
        ### <u>HUD</u>
          Finally, the last of the main tasks assigned has been to implement in code the requirements of our UX designers, in this case, my partner [Maria Calle](/maria), in charge of art and HUD design. 
          <br/>
      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Supportive Role</u>
          As I mentioned earlier, a sub-task I have been doing throughout the project has been to help relieve work and pressure on my colleagues who have needed help. 
          <br/>
        ### <u>QA and Engine Improvements</u>
          Also, for some time in the project, I have been in charge of Quality Assurance and possible Engine Improvements. What does this consist of? Adding new features to our engine, and the possibility of fixing and improving existing ones.
