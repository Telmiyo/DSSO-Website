    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        My main role in this project has been Designer. 
        I have also contributed in organizing and supervising part of the Programming department. 
        Not only that, I have almost always been the Scrum Master in the Sprints, so I've been able to keep track of how things were going.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Boss Design</u>
          I have been the main designer for everything related to the Boss. Created the idea with [Abraham David Diaz](/abraham) and further developed it later on. 
          I wanted to have a boss both memorable and hard to face, I wanted to give it personality. I believe that a boss in a video game must feel rewarding to beat,
          and is also one of the core characters in the story. At the beginning, it would have had three main phases, each one interesting and challenging. At the end though,
          we ended having a simplified version of it, but I am still proud of the whole process.

          Rabban Harkonnen was born:

          The last battle was designed:

          In the end, we did what we could:

        ### <u>Supervising the Programming Department</u>
          Although being very stressful, it is at the same time what felt most rewarding for me. Talking with different programmers so each one could be aware of what the others were doing, 
          planning meetings and knowing exactly how the developing was going was amazing. It was not a lot of time, maybe three or four weeks, but for me this is one 
          of my major contributions to the whole project.
          It is been a great experience. I know that I have made some mistakes but thanks to that I have learned a lot. 

        ### <u>Mentat Design</u>
          I also designed several enemies. The most important one is the Mentat, which would be the equivalent of a mage (a summoner more specifically)
          in a classic fantasy game. Sadly, we did not have the time to implement it in the engine.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Enemies Behaviours</u>
          In the early stage of development, I worked on explaining and analizing the enemies and characters behaviours with [Eduard Minguell](/eduard). We needed to know exactly how they
          behaved so the programmers could develop the proper Artificial Intelligence.

        ### <u>Testing</u>
          The last weeks I have been mainly testing the game and participating in major design decisions. It was mostly playing the game, changing numbers and finding bugs.
          Overall I didn't enjoy doing it and could have done more.

        ### <u>Level Tutorial Design</u>
          I also helped with the design of the first level of the game. After [Arnau Lucena](/arnau) did the first, top down, draft of the level, I iterated it again in 3D using Inkscape.

     # Projects
        Here I present three projects that I have enjoyed doing in this degree and that I am very proud of.

          ## Tricaltion
            This was for Game Design II and I did it with [Arnau Lucena](/arnau) and [Abraham David Diaz](/abraham). It consisted of three parts.
            The design of a fantasy world, the creation of an interactive story, and the developlement of a simulations program. Since what I 
            love the most is writing fiction and creating worlds, this assignment has probably been one of my favourites in the whole career.

            The map of Tricaltion:

            And click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xKOFB-owGjeJpKeI3iXA-Uu3e4ip9mww?usp=sharing) for the folder of the assignment.

          ## Modeling an Environment
            For the subject of 3D Environments I created an underground crystalline cavern. I spent a lot of hours immersed in Unreal Engine creating a 
            fantastic and strongly narrative scenario. I enjoyed it a lot and I am very proud of having reached that level of detail while having
            no prior experience. 

            Video Demonstration

          ## Shattered Dreams
            With my good friends [Guillem Alava](/guillem), [Sergi Colomer](/sergi), [Arnau Lucena](/arnau) and [Abraham David Diaz](/abraham), we developed 
            a game for the subject Project II. It is a turn-based RPG with a strong narrative. It talks about mental health and the life of a boy who is struggling to
            find meaning in life.
