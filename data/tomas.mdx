description: "Hi! I'm Tomás, I've been one of the programmers in this project. For me, this has been not only a great
experience as a programmer but also as a person, since I didn't know anyone in the team when we started, and I've been lucky enough
to get to know this amazing group of people and work alongside them in what's been a very challenging journey.

      ## About Me
        I started this degree without much idea of what it was I wanted to do but I quickly came
        to the conclusion that programming was my field and my future, decision I have reinforced only
        after working in Project II and now Project III as a programmer. 

        This subject has been the biggest test I've endured and yet it has also been the project I 
        have enjoyed the most by far. These months have been a true challenge to my programming, my
        social and my teamworking skills and the results have been better than I could have 
        imagined in all three fields.

        > We should have gone for C#

      ## Hard Skills
        - C++/C#/C
        - Lua
        - Git

      ## Soft Skills
        - Cooperation
        - Branch management
        - Flexibility

      ## Project Overview
        For this project, I mainly had the role of *Gameplay Programmer*. My job for the first two months was implementing
        the Lua scripting system into our engine. After that I've been in charge of gameplay.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Scripting System</u>
          I developed the script components which integrated the Lua language into the engine. It's main features
          are hot reloading and the ability to modify variables through the engine inspector panel.
        ### <u>Gameplay Programming</u>
          As soon as the scripts were ready to go I started working on the gameplay. I worked on the three characters:
          Zhib, Nerala and Omozra each with 4 abilities, on the enemies interaction with the players and the behaviour of the
          Sardaukar.
        ### <u>Lua Tutorials</u>
          As I was the one who integrated Lua into our engine, I also tried to be there to help my teammates understand the
          system and use it as best as they could.
      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Outline Shader</u>
          I also started implementing the outline shader alongside [Bosco Barber](/bosco).
        ### <u>Intro Transitions</u>
          I was also in charge of the intro scenes and the transitions between then.
