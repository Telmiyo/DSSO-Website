      ## About Me
        Ever since I was in Middle School, I had a problem deciding what I wanted to be in life, always torn between prefering 
        a creative path versus a technological one. Being a student of the bachelor's degree in Video Game Development and Design 
        at CITM UPC has been a great opportunity for me to test them both and further develop my knowledge in the two areas. Even though 
        the experience helped me, in some ways it also confused me for the first three years. I saw most of my classmates with all these 
        great ambitions and a clear idea of what they wanted to do, but I still couldn't decide, because I learned that I liked both paths.

        I still remember the day we had to choose our role in the project. I was so stressed and didn't make up my mind until the last minute.
        Thankfully, I decided to be part of the programming team. Working in this project has been a revealing opportunity in a lot of ways. It 
        has taught me a lot about programming, like creating an engine or coding in Lua, and team work. But most importantly it has helped me
        discover what I liked the most; visual programming and design.

        I am extremely grateful for this eye-opening experience and hope to, one day, be able to work in what I enjoy the most.

      ## Project Overview
        For the project, I was mainly in charge of programming all the UI of the game. This included, but 
        was not limited to, the menus, HUD and Cutscenes.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Menu Implementation</u>
          For this project, I was in charge of implementing all the menus of the game. This consisted on creating all the scripts in Lua 
          necessary for the buttons, sliders and transitions to work properly.  In order to do my task correctly I had to 
          work hand-to-hand with the design team.

          I started with the most simple ones; the main menu, game over screen and winning screen, and then I worked my way up to those 
          which required a more complex implementation, such as the transition screen or the settings. Finally, I created the pause menu that can
          be found inside the levels.

          Taking this into consideration, some of the menus ended up needing a rework from the art team and, therefore the final implementation 
          is product of other programmers. 

        ### <u>Cutscenes Implementation</u>
          After some sprints, since I was the one with teh most knowledge regarding the workflow of the UI implementation, I was given the 
          task of creating all the scripts related the cutscenes. Also for this task I had to work hand-in-hand with the designers.

          I was able to implement the following cutscenes:
          - Introduction
          - Level 1 to level 2
          - Nerala's death
          - Rabban's death
          - Final

          Even though this task didn't require a higher knowledge in programming, it was slow to do and, therefore it took me a long time 
          to complete.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Prefabs</u>
          Regarding the engine, I created the prefab feature. This works by creating a .json file for every game object set as prefab.

        ### <u>Scripting Module</u>
          At the first stages of the project, I worked hand-to-hand with [Tomás Carreras](/tomas) in order to create the scripting module. This 
          took a lot of investigation from us regarding the different possible scripting languages and implementation inside the engine.

        ### <u>HUD Implementation</u>
          Even though, this was one of the main tasks I did, its art needed a rework and, after it was done, another programmer took over my 
          place and re-implemented the HUD with all the new assets. It included the functionality of lives, abilities and character selection.

        ### <u>Game Loop</u>
          For this project, I was in charge of implementing the game loop for the last delivery. This meant making the connection between
          all of the different levels and menus, as well as cutscenes.

     # Projects
        In this section, you can find three projects I did in the last years.

          ## Cat Escape
            Cat Escape is a 3D interactive map created with Unreal Engine by Irene Hernández,
            María Calle and Paula Hitz for our university subject 3D Environments.
            In this class we developed different skills such as 3D modelling and programming
            with Unreal Engine.

          ## UnderEvil
            UnderEvil is an RPG game created by FM Studios, a group of 7 students for our
            university subject called Project II (CITM UPC). In this class we had the chance
            to make our own 2D RPG playable game for PC. My role in this project was more of a designer one.

          ## The Atelier
            The Atelier is a VR game made with the Oculus Quest 2 headset about potion crafting. The prototype for 
            this game was developed for the VR/AR class (CITM UPC). I had a programmer role in this project.
