      ## About Me
        A passionate student when it comes to themes I like, when it came to choose
        a carreer, after choosing poorly the first time, I had to reevaluate what I
        wanted to do, after deciding that videogames had shaped who I am since I was
        a child, I started to look on how to become a game maker and I stumbled upon 
        this degree.

        While on it, I got to try out different fields, and everytime, design started to
        stand out more and more, It became more obvious when the specific game design subjects
        came along and I just fell in love. Later on I started to look for a more concrete title,
        as "I am a designer" was too general, soon enough I discovered what I love especifically:
        - Character Design
        - Narrative Design
        - Community Management in general
        with special mention to Animation which I found out I wans't half bad at and enjoy making
        but decided it wasn't for me. 

        > Happiness is only real when shared.
        <br/>- Christopher McCandless

        I am a people's man, who enjoys interacting and and talking with people a lot, I enjoy solving 
        misunderstandings among people and finding quick solutions to sudden problems. As well as reading
        the backstories of my favorite characters and the worldbuilding around them. 

        Being part of this project was a really important step on my journey as a game designer, as the
        biggest teams I had worked until now were of around 5 people, I got to be part of decisions that 
        shaped a few aspects of the game (mainly character design and character model supervising) and I feel happy about it, otherwise, worked a bit on everything 
        design related.

      ## Project Overview
        On this project, I had the honor to be part of our talented group of *Designers*. 
        Worked all around on with them setting the bases of the game, the story, the characters, the enemies, etc.


      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Boss design (1st concepts)</u>
          Me and [Aram Galarza](/aram) started defining the boss of the game, a boss has to be remembered and has to present
          a direct test of your player skills. Although hee kept that as his main rol as the boss designer while I started to
          work on different fields, I'm glad I helped creating the version we have of Rabban The Beast.

        ### <u>Extra Characters</u>
          I worked with [Nuria Lamonja](/nuria) in making 2 extra characters and their backstories in case we had time to implement them.
          Even thhough they didn't make it to the final game, I love the concepts we ended up with and would love to see them come to live.
          Here is a small peek at the mood board of Hunar, what woudl have been our muscular Tinkerer.

        ### <u>First Draft of Spice Management</u>
          I was in charge of making a 1st draft of how the spice, the resource of our game, would work on our game, how much would be given to
          the player, how much would they would spend on upgrading skills and abilities.

        ### <u>Cutscenes and Story Boarding</u>
          Together with [Aitor Alvarez](/aitor) we were in charge of making the storyboarding of the cutscnees that would be on the game, we 
          made quite a few quick drafts so the artist had a good directions on how to make and render the actual cutscenes. Later on development 
          I was assigned to fix and change the storyboards given the time constraints and changings on the story taht needed to be done.
          Here a small show of storyboard cutscenes that made it to the end, at least the ones made by me, to see the final result that our artist worked so hard on,
          check out the profiles of [Victor Jara](/Victor), [Marti Davicino](/martid) and [Carles Lopéz](/carles).

        ### <u>Testing Sesion Surveys</u>
          Due to time constraints, we couldn't make a formal playtesting sesion. I was in charge of making the play testing socument, with the surveys and the procedure to follow as test organizers.

        ### <u>Dialogues and Tutorials</u>
          I was in charge of implementing the dialogues and tutorials inside the engine, editing the previous dialogues we had because it didn't fit our new need (we had 
          dialogues for 3 levels, due to limitations we coudl only implement 2). I changed edited adn implemented a first iteration of the tutorials inside the level too,
          our Design Lead [Maria Calle](/maria) gave new indications to do the tutorials according to the few testings the team was able to do, and the dialogues had to change 
          yet again to fit the needs of the last iteration of the story.

          All in all an entertaining job to do since I had to be on the characters shoes to think what would they say on what spots and mix that with what were we able to put in
          the engine following the limitations our programers warned us about.

        
        ### <u>Unity and Engine Testing, as well as debugging</u>
          Given the amount of time I spent among different tasks interactign asn usign the engine, I also helped find bugs and errors in general for the programers to fix.

          I also Tested on the Unity port to find values and changes that needed to be done on the overall game.

        ### <u>Supervision of Model creation</u>
          The task was not assigned to me but I was endeared to stay in contact with the modelers, mainly [Marti Davicino](/martid), to supervise, give example and explanaitions from a designer
          standpoint and give and ask opinions about character models, It was one of the jobs I liked the most since I gave a few ideas and helpful feedback on the process of modelling.

      ## Secondary Tasks

        ### <u>The RTS approach</u>
          Together with [Aram Galarza](/aram) we made a complete study about one posible approach to the main gameplay
        ### <u>Level one on the engine (one of many iterations)</u>
          Participated on one of the first attemps of translating the bloackouts of my colleagues into early versions of the engine.
          Given the unstability of the engine at the moment, gave the idea of doing the level on another program and then importing 
          it on the engine instead of doing it on the engine itself, which later helped anyone who needed to do bloackouts.
        ### <u>Support on making the level 3 on Blender</u>
          I helped [Arnau Lucena](/arnau) a bit with the making of the whole fbx of the second level.

        ### <u>Implementing Final Level on the engine</u>
          I spend a week trying to make the final level in the engine, due to the instability at the time of said engine, I had to start again a few times until the idea came to
          do pick up the fbx from blender and import it directly to the engine, that way, we could build the level without fighting the unstability of the engine
        
        ### <u>Implementing Final Level on the engine</u>
          I spend a week trying to make the final level in the engine, due to the instability at the time of said engine, I had to start again a few times until the idea came to
          do pick up the fbx from blender and import it directly to the engine, that way, we could build the level without fighting the unstability of the engine
        
        ### <u>Help in Unity</u>
          I helped a bit with the implementation of the port to unity for testing purpuses, didn't do much more than changing a few values and testign a bit before we starting heavily testing
        
        ### <u>Values from the Unity Port to the Engine</u>
          I helped and mostly just supervised [Aitor Alvarez](/aitor) on the procces of translating the values the team set on the unity testing stringht to the engine.

          ## Tricaltion
            This was part of a design delivery I did in conjuction with [Aram Galarza](/aram) and [Arnau Lucena](/arnau), and i am quite proud of the result, it was an exercise on world building
            character creation and the making of an adventure inside the world we created with the characters we made.

            You can see [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14HGkaw_ThWaBDScEWYetTdBG6gVfdH9T?usp=sharing) the drive folder of this the whole project.
            And here a sneak peek of the map.

          ## Artemis 21
            Artemis 21 was born on a Game Jam I made with a close group of friends, we call ourselfs Bruhmentium Inc. when we work together, they are [Guillem Álava](/guillem), [Sergi Colomer](/sergi),
            [Arnau Lucena](/arnau), [Aram Galarza](/aram) and me.
            I am quite proud of what we managed to assemble on the 2 days we had of our first gamejam, I was in charge of naming characters, writting the story and overall design. as well as directing team dynamics.

            If you want to check it out for yourself, you can find it published in [itch.io](https://bruhmentium-inc.itch.io/artemis-21).

          ## Stairway to Nirvana
            This is a project that we delivered on the Videogame Design 2 subject, I want to highlight the design of the cards and the concept of the game which is where I worked the most.
            I liked the result and my design work on balancing the game. [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Myh2vtImFOWvIDr22XUPPBgzD9p94eWUtgyreMO3lMQ/edit?usp=sharing) you can see the final slides we did and here
