description: "Hello, my name is Mart Buxeda, and I'm on a quest to find absolute silence!
In this project, I primarily took on the role of musician and 2D artist, but I also did some coding. 
This project assisted me in discovering new types of music. I learned a lot about the code that 
powers audio systems, as well as the laborious work of graphic design and concept art
I think it's a fantastic opportunity to learn about how the real industry operate, and everyone should 
try it at least once!"

      ## About Me
        I've always imagined life as a hardmode videogame in which your first chance is your last.

        > That's why we're here, to tell our story.

        I've been in contact with music since I was a child, and it has saved me 
        from some difficult situations in my life, so I'd like to repay her kindness. 
        I've been studying music since I was three years old, and I now consider myself a 
        musician as well as a music producer. 
        
        Music is a powerful tool for telling your story, but video games are equally effective. 
        This was the impetus for enrolling in a degree in Video Game Development and Design at CITM UPC.
        
        **Marti Buxeda** is a programmer who enjoys innovating and creating strange mechanics that transport people 
        to a fast-paced adventure where time flies. 
        But on the other hand, he has a **SIDE B** called **Raxer Sound**. This entity is in charge of his 
        musical side, managing sound and musical creativity in order to create and compose musical pieces for any purpose.

        I consider myself a proactive person who puts his heart and soul into what he does. But, of course:
        > Abilities have a limitation, they onlu occur when you're interested on what youre doing!
        And I'm really interested in videogames and music!

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        My main role was Artist, developing several 2d enemy concepts, creating the first iteration of the
        hud, and producing the soundtrack of the complete game. I also took a programming role regarding the
        coding the audio system that the engine featured.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>2D Graphic Related</u>
          - Drawing of the 2d concept of 3 of the enemies in the game. Basically, 3 approaches for each one with its characteristic weapons and possible masks.

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/martib_harkonnen_concept_art.png" width={600} height={343}/>

          - Designed the first iteration of the hud, the transition screen and the UI elements in the game. Finally some of them where changed for a more minimalistic ones.
          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/martib_ui_concept_art.png" width={600} height={343}/>

          - Composed the icons for the main abilities of the protagonists. Each one has 3 abilities which are shown on the hud of the gameplay.
          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/martib_ability_conteps_art.png" width={600} height={343}/>

        ### <u>Music Related</u>
          - Composition of the complete soundtrack of the game: 
              1. Desert, Level 1. This music must transmit uncertainty in a desertic area. 
              There are 3 approaches of the same song depending on the situation of the player.

              <SoundCloudCard audioId="1285426078"/>
              <SoundCloudCard audioId="1285426072"/>
              <SoundCloudCard audioId="1285426060"/>
              <br/>

              2. Castle, Level 2. This music conveys faded sensation in a dark and sad castle. 
              There are 3 approaches of the same song depending on the situation of the player.

              <SoundCloudCard audioId="1285426048"/>
              <SoundCloudCard audioId="1285426036"/>
              <SoundCloudCard audioId="1285426027"/>
              <br/>

              3. Main Theme. In this case, it gives a feeling of adventure or journey, with its desertic touch.
              This music has 2 approaches, one played in the Main Menu, and the other one in the Final Boss Battle.

              <SoundCloudCard audioId="1285426093"/>
              <SoundCloudCard audioId="1285426018"/>
              <br/>

          - Creation of the sound effects of the videogame.
              This was one of the most difficult tasks. There are more than 50 sound effects in all. Each of them were made by me, 
              using recorded sounds or samples from libraries, as well as synths. There has been no original sfx taken and implemented 
              directly from an existing one. However, the sampling technique has occurred, and in certain circumstances, external 
              samples have been utilized as layering, but they have always been modified in some way.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Audio System coding</u>
          The audio system developed for the engine, is based on a structure similar to a "Unity Component", but not quite the same. 
          The "Audio Switch Component" can be selected from the inspector, and asigned to an specific gameobject.
          
          The Audio System uses as a main library OpenAL, and to decode the sudio files, a library called DrWav has been used.
          It allows formats such as .wav, .mp3 and .flac. 
          *The audio system featured spatial audio, but there wasn't enough time to implement it in the engine*

          General Features: Multitrack, Track Switching (crossfade between 2 tracks), Fade Time Drag and Offset Sync.

          <br/>

          Track-Specific Features: Offset, Mute, Bypass FX, Loop, Custom Loop (choose where the loop starts), Play On Awake and 
          Editor: Volume Fader, Transpose Knowb, Pan Knob, Time slider, Effects (Reverb, Distortion, Flanger, Chorus...)

        ### <u>Music for the trailer</u>
          I simply altered some of the actual game parts to fit into an emotional and powerful trailer.
          This task was completed in collaboration with [Víctor Jara](/victor), who was in charge of editing the trailer itself.
