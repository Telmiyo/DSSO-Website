    # Background
      ## About Me
        I am someone who has been submerged in video games from a very young age, and thus, I have grown with them to the point where they have become a passion. 
        Entering the videogame industry has been a wish I had for very long, learning about it and finally realizing that I would be able to enter it as 
        a designer, as during these last years I noticed that I am especially proficient in it, which makes sense by virtue of my love towards video game narrative
        and design.

        Of course, even though I love video games, I know that this industry is quite rotten, with pretty much all triple A companies releasing the same game every year
        at full price, exploitative techniques that try to wring out every single cent of the customer, horrible work ethics, or even workplace abuse. This opinion has only
        been reinforced every passing year, scandal after scandal, mediocre product after mediocre product. This is why, long ago, I started looking at the indie part of 
        the industry, which, although not fully free of these faults, is filled with much better practices and products, as well as a passion towards creativity, innovation 
        and storytelling which the triple A industry has long forsaken.

        Thus, as someone who considers themselves a cynical individual with a passion for indie games, it is my ideal to some day join a smaller studio that has managed to make 
        a name in the industry, and dedicate my time to designing a good game, as well as perhaps, some day, making my own title. After all, If I have to work on something,
        it will be something I enjoy and can be proud of in the end.

        > I feel that a world in which you only see what you want to see is incomplete. And as a game creator, I am only here to prepare a game that will expand the breadth of your thinking, and leave the decision between good and evil up to the players.
        
        - Yoko Taro, Videogame director.

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        As a designer, my influence in this project has mainly been about shaping the game's experience with my colleagues,
        especially when it comes to the game's levels and mechanics, as those were what I focused the most on.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Level Design</u>
         Since the first week of our project, I have been creating level concepts and iterations, as well as the progression, encounters and mechanics that 
         compose them, and have even made blockouts of them.

         <Image src="/contents/screenshots/arnau_level_blockout.png" width={553} height={333}/>

         This has been my favourite part of this whole project, as I consider level design one of my favourite aspects of videogames, 
         and thus, I made sure to create levels as unique and interesting as possible so that the would be a good foundation for gameplay, 
         even learning how to use software like Inkscape and Blender to make sure I properly plastered their design, and making many iterations
         during the project's development to adapt to the game's situtation, making sure that it would be on plausible standards regarding its creation 
         and implementation.

        ### <u>Testing</u>
          Another big task that I was assigned to has been testing the builds of the game to make sure that the experience would be 
          a fair, balanced and interesting one. And most of all, to make sure that the game feel we designers wanted to create was being implemented properly.

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/arnau_testing.png" width={588} height={334}/>

          Many iterations and discussions were taken during this long process, and a lot has changed overall,
          with many stats being changed and many mechanics being tweaked, which were all recorded and documented 
          through changelogs and stat documents.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Resource Flow Rework</u>
        To adapt to the game's current state in that time, a second iteration of the game's resource system was made, 
        which acted pretty much as a complete overhaul.

        <Image src="/contents/screenshots/arnau_spice_flow.png" width={520} height={564}/>

        This rework was made using Machinations, and although it went through some minor changes later in the proyect,
        the foundation and formulas remained the same.

        ### <u>Game Feedback Listing and SFX Supervision</u>
        To have clear idea on what inputs the player would receive throughout the game, I was tasked with creating a list that encompassed all of the game's
        feedback that acted as a foundation, encompassing characters, enemies, UI and environmental visual, aud auditory feedbacks.

        This later led to being assigned with the task of listing all SFX's that had to be made for the game, giving concise descriptions,
        examples and feedback to make sure they would sound and feel as intended.

        ### <u>Skill Design</u>
        Part of the overall design and testing progress was to create and implement the character's skills, as well as decide their base 
        and leveled up stats. Furthermore, during the development progress, some abilities had to be largely modified or fully remade, which I took
        part of with my colleagues.

        ### <u>HUD Implementation Supervision</u>
        Although it was completely reworked, I was in charge of supervising the original HUD implementation and designing any missing elements,
        and even though I was not part of the rework that put the HUD's final version in the game, some of my design inputs and feedback were kept in it.

     # Projects

          ## Tricaltion
            Tricaltion is a proyect I created with [Abraham David Díaz](/abraham) and [Aram Galarza](/aram) during our third year of the degree in the 
            Videogame Design II subject, where we created a whole world with a narrative, gameplay and resource system. Creating an extensive file talking
            about all of that in great detail, and using software like Machinations and Twine to retell the story and show the resource diagram.

            This project is my pride, as my colleagues and I believe the end result was a magnificent one, and I am very proud of the Machinations resource diagram 
            and Twine interactive story made, as I was the one who mainly took care of them.

            <Image src="/contents/screenshots/arnau_world_resource_diagram.png" width={600} height={200}/>
            
            You can see our proyect [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xKOFB-owGjeJpKeI3iXA-Uu3e4ip9mww?usp=sharing), where you will be able
            to access the multiple story and gameplay documents, as well as an .exe that is a combat simulator we used for theoretical balancing and an .html file
            made with Twine that narrates the whole story as an interactive adventure.

          ## Artemis 21
            Artemis 21 is a platformer game created with the help of [Sergi Colomer](/sergi), [Abraham David Díaz](/abraham),
            [Aram Galarza](/aram) & [Guillem Álava](/guillem) for the Gran CITM Game Jam for the ODS, celebrated during the 4th and the 5th of February 2021 
            in which you investigate an unknown planet in search for wildlife. It is a simple project where me and my friends got introduced to Unity, 
            with me acting as a designer, especially regarding level design, and programmer, and was the first Game Jam I ever participated in.

            If you want to check it out for yourself, you can find it published in [itch.io](https://bruhmentium-inc.itch.io/artemis-21).

          ## VR Project: AimLab VR
          AimLab VR is a Virtual Reality project I created during the third year of the degree with [Abraham David Díaz](/abraham) and [Aram Galarza](/aram), which
          is a VR prototype that tries to imitate Aim Lab's shooter training in a Virtual Reality scenario, allowing the user to handle a pistol in which they will 
          have to shoot targets during a short period of time while trying to hit every shot, as the project tracked the amount of targets hit through a score screen
          and the amount of shots hit through an accuracy screen. This is a proyect I am quite proud of, as it was a first step towards VR development, and a lot of
          scripting was involved in the project, which I did the most of.

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/arnau_AimLabVR.png" width={524} height={365}/>

          Funny enough, we later learned that Aim Lab has an official VR version of the game, which our prototype is by no means related to, as it is just a study project.

          If you are interested in trying this prototype, you can get the APK here [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2OCeaNDIwc142XrW80kY1TGgdx04-I8/view?usp=sharing).
