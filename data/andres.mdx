  # Background
    ## About Me
    
      I started coding at sixteen as a hobby in high school, I spend a couple summers 
      Coding on Unity some mini-games and I began to be more and more interested on game-development.
      
      This grade is giving me the opportunity to aim for the professional career I dream of.
      This project made me easier to approach what is to be a professional in the sector and complemented by some books 
      I read about videogames journalism, I got an idea of ​​sacrifice and bravery that the industry asks for.<br/>

      I haven't had doubts in which my role was, even though I'm interested in game design I know my place is on the programming side of the game.<br/>

      I consider myself as a person who works hard and with a high ability to react against adversity, the main thing I would highlight me 
      Is the capacity I have for creating original and interesting ideas that solve problems.

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        For the project I was part of the programming team, I was working with my fellows daily in order to achieve the objective. 

      ## Main Tasks

        ### <u>Module Animation</u>
          The first task I was in charge was difficult to code
          as it was the first time I was writting code at a deep-engine level, the module included from the 
          Import Animation section that mimetized assimp data into our own format. To the mesh-deformation part
          that got the structs in the data and used them to move the polygons faithfully to the artists animations.  o.<br/><br/>

          All of the different points I had to cover:
          - Animation Importing
          - Data Managing
          - Bone creation and placement
          - Keyframes and position through time 
          - Bugfixing referred to all the colateral effects on the engine

          All of the different points I had to cover:
          - Animation Importing
          - Data Managing
          - Bone creation and placement
          - Keyframes and position through time 
          - Bugfixing referred to all the side effects on the engine

        ### <u>Scene Transition</u>
          The second think I did was making the scene Transition, the scene where the upgrades are being purchased.<br/><br/>

          The main features of the scene were the following.<br/><br/>

          - Change Characters on rotate
          - UI Responsiveness to the central character 
          - Level Up skills
          - Level Down Skills
          - Checkbox implementation from button
          - Locked Checkbox logic
          - Skill description extracted from Json
          - Skill level and spice saving into GameState.<br/><br/>

        ### <u>Unlock System</u>
          The third thing I did was the Unlock System, the system unlocks characters that are not available on gameplay and 
          Make them selectable or unselectable for the player, as it also involves scene transition, the characters that are not available would 
          Not be displayed on the screen, the system is triggered by dialogue and has UI feedback driven by Json<br/><br/>.

        ### <u>Memory Leaks</u>
          As I was with the bug fixing task i realized that the engine was crashing too often, then I realised we were not deleting 
          huge quantities of memory that made our engine crash when we reached 2GB maximum.
          
          I identified a lot of mistakes on dynamic memory placement, mallocs and deletes missing aswell as some CleanUps not being
          called correctly, at the end of the journey I reached a decreasement of 150MB in a 500 MB scene that made the engine avoid the crash 
          about 6 iterations later...<br/><br/>.

        ### <u>Camera Movement</u>
          Camera Implementation In-Gameplay<br/><br/>.

          - Migration of the work from Engine to the Dune executable repository
          - Camera movement with WASD
          - Camera movement with mouse hitting the borders
          - Compatibility of the two mentioned above 
          - Camera rotation with Q and E
          - Camera rotation with wheelmouse dragging
          - Smoothness of all the mentioned above
          - General Bux fixing
          - Map limits 

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Bug Fixing</u>
          # <u>Bug Fixing</u>
          The third thing i did was Bug Fixing, as the engine is done by a young core of programers with lack
          of experience it had bugs, I was in charge of fixing them<br/><br/>.

          I fixed three main big bugs:
          - Events triggering without limits: events were triggering from all the states of the engine (Pause, stop and play) and I capped that 
          for the developers no to be messing with colliders.
          - Autoatack Crash: The autoatack was not capped for a long time so you were able to attack every time you clicked a enemy what made the game just 
          explode.
          - Players colliding between them: Players were colliding with each other rigid bodies and it made the game unplayable.

        ### <u>Multipicking and Engine Improvements</u>
          The second think I did was helping the designers to use more fluidly the engine, I was in charge
          Of the Unity-like Multipicking of our engine, it gives me some problems with the rotation and scale matrices
          As our gizmo was not adapted to the topic, but I arrived to a result finally.<br/><br/>

          Multipicking engloves the possibility to pick multiple objects and move them with only one gizmo-slide.<br/><br/>

          I was also in charge of other engine Improvements as:
          
          - Change Scene Paralellization
          - Scene Identification (name)
          - Hierarchy Smoothness and Bug Fixing.<br/><br/>

          Generally, I tried to help the designers in the use of the engine, trying to fix the negative feedback they give to me. 

        ### <u>Quality Of Life</u>
          # <u>Harkonen Patrolling</u>
          I made a inspector button for the waypoint list to push back the position of the transform in order to avoid
          the manual copy of the position to the waypoints array, that helped a lot the people in charge of enemies because 
          they waste least time on patrolling routes. 

        ### <u>General UI Work</u>
            # <u>Cursor Switcher</u>
          I made the function In-Engine that switches the cursor UI depending of the hover in-game, changing it from default to
          The Attack Cursor / Pick Cursor / UI Hover Cursor. 
            # <u>Skills Pop Up</u>
          I made the skill description pop-up system where if you hover some of the skills in the gameplay it displays a description
          Of it. 
            # <u>Logo Animation in Transition</u>
          I made the logo animation for the Loading Screen, honest work.

    # Projects
      In this section you will find out all the projects i've been involved.

       ## Pengo
        Pengo is an arcade replic we made in our first year at the grade, it's from the subject Project I.
        I'm so happy with the result as it was the first game we did from scratch.

      ## UnderEvil
        UnderEvil is an RPG game created by FM Studios, a group of 7 students for our
        university subject called Project II (CITM UPC). In this class we had the chance
        to make our own engine and make a 2D RPG playable game for PC.

      ## The Tower
        The Tower is a mobile game I've been working on for the last year and I plan to finish it with me
        TFG, it's a mobile clicker game that has the only objective of making a Tower grow, it plays with different
        Building branches and other design elements as the king that upgrades your stats or the islands that complement
        The tower with passive upgrades.

      ##Off-Industry
        ### Sexenni
        Finally i want to mention that all the work of this year was collated with my side job that is my music band.
        It is not a hobby either a non profitable job as we're signed with a label and a management company and we were on tour all the semester.
        We released an album on April the first that made the semester so intense, I want to thank the whole group for the understanding.
