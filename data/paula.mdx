description: "Hello everyone, my name is Paula Hitz. I was lucky enough to be the Producer for this project, and with
little to no practice organizing teams, I had the chance to discover what my passion is inside the video game industry.
Organizing a team of 25 students, including myself, has been a remarkable experience that will hopefully prepare me for what
the future has yet to bring.

    ## About Me

      Being a student of the bachelor's degree in Video Game Development and Design 
      at CITM UPC has opened a lot of doors for me in this industry, from obtaining 
      extensive programming skills to gaining knowledge on how to design and produce
      artistically a good video game. In addition to that, due to the great amount of 
      projects we do every year for the career, we had the opportunity to learn what it
      is to work as a team of two or three students, to a team of 25 students.

      It took me a while to find what path in my career to pursue, since I never
      imagined myself working in a company as a 3D modeller or a level designer, to put some
      examples. Time passed by as well as subjects we did in the course, and I still didn't
      find what I was passionate about. That's where Project III came in.

      I consider myself a person who loves organization and planification, as well as
      leadership and team communication. When I found out there was a role in the
      subject where someone had to be in charge for the project management, I dived right
      into the opportunity. I am extremely grateful for this experience as it proved to
      me that there was actually a role for me inside this industry.

    > Planning is bringing the future into the present.

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        For the project, I had the role of *Producer*. My job was to implement the use of
        an agile methodology into the project, making important decisions as well as ensuring
        that all requirements for the game are met. 

      ## Main Tasks

        ### <u>Production Plan</u>
          I was mainly in charge of making sure the team understood and used the scrum framework
          in order to make our project. A production plan was made where all of the information on 
          how we were going to work on our project was stated. I also made a presentation to the 
          class about what it means to follow the scrum framework and what steps we had to take 
          to make it effective and useful for us.

          All of the different points I had to cover in the production plan about the scrum 
          framework were the following:
          - Sprints
          - Milestones
          - Backlog
          - Scrum Teams
          - Tools (HacknPlan, Drive and Github Issues)
          - Risks

          You can head to the *Production* tab in order to see 
          in full detail the agile methodology implementation.

        ### <u>Problem Solving & Decision Making</u>
          With a big project ahead and a big team, problems were expected to come. We had 
          some issues within the team, as well as tension, due to lack of time and a huge 
          amount of stress. My job was to relieve this tension and try to make the project
          move forward no matter how many obstacles crossed our paths.

          This consisted in ensuring a good communication between the parties envolved, as
          well as an empathetic mindset when working with people. At the end of the day,
          our mission was to make a product that we all were proud of, and it was our duty
          to work as a team in order to achieve it. My role as a producer was to keep the team
          unified until the very end.

          In addition, decision making became more and more important when we were reaching the
          end of the project. Many decisions had to be made due to the lack of time, so, with
          help of the leads, we needed to prioritize and redirect the project into a game
          that had something to offer.

          Generally, I tried to let the leads take the decisions for their teams, nevertheless,
          I had to intervene in certain occasions for the sake of the project, since it was my task
          to keep the general vision of the game and make those decisions taking into account the
          state of our project. 

        ### <u>Centralizing Communication</u>
          As a producer, one of my main tasks was to serve as a mediator between our university,
          specifically with our investors (teachers), the lead of each department, and all
          of the members of the team. This meant filtering as well as planning and organizing
          requirements for the project, evaluation for the members, and solving any conflicts
          or issues.

          In order to fufill this task, different types of meetings were held constantly,
          such as daily meetings between departments, daily leads meetings, weekly meetings
          with the investors, and weekly meetings with the leads.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Marketing</u>
          I also took the role as the marketing figure of the project, by creating an Instagram
          account where we would give insights of who Chamfer Studios is as well what is the
          game we have developed.

        ### <u>Evaluation</u>
          At the end of every sprint, I did, with the help of the leads, a report on how each member
          was working for that week. This including an attendance to class, as well as to their daily
          meetings, an hour log, the list of tasks they worked on, the grade the leads would give them,
          as well as additional comments from the leads on how they were working.

          This information was very useful for our investors to have an insight on how each member
          is collaborating in the project, which they had in mind when grading them.
