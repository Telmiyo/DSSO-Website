    ## About Me
    <Image src="/contents/screenshots/name_photo.png" width={600} height={300}/>
      When choosing what I wanted to do after Selectivity, I was torn between diffent options. One of them was this degree, but I ended up studying to become and engineer. However, I absolutely hated it. I consider myself an explorer, always eager to learn, find and build, and it seemed that was lacking. I wanted to create stories, so after three years I was set to change my path.<br/>

      Coming from a more technical background, I loved everything about this degree: programming with new languages, using new software and learning about new stuff. Nevertheless, as I stated before, it was clear where I was headed. For example, when it came to the subjects of Project II as the lead or Desgin developing worlds and games, I thrived. I've had many setbakc during these past few years, but I finally felt at home.<br/>

      When it comes to Project III, I also saw it as an opportunity to challenge my limits. I always fall into the lead role, but I needed a change of pace and it was a good experience to learn how to let go of things and being more proactive in a less speakperson-way. I got to challenge other designers as equals, ask the why of things and just create.<br/>

      I know that in the future I will be doing a lot of things, but now I feel more confident in myself and my creations.<br/>

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        For the project, I had the role of *Designer*. I had to work with other designers when thinking about the gameplay, documentation part, style of the game and more, as well as working with other departments to ensure that our tasks were carried out successfully. My main task was to create the characters in this game, as well as the documentation and lore of the world.

      ## Main Tasks

        ### <u>Documentation</u>
          My first job was to get to know the world we were going to be borrowing.<br/><br/>
          
          Together with [Aitor](/aitor) we were in charge of learning all the lore, hierarchies, priorities, storyline and more. This was done to avoid inconsistencies. We also did the research for other games related to ours, such as other RTTs and past Dune games. In addition, I did all the research about deserts and their climate and flora.

        ### <u>Character Designer</u>
          Together with [Aitor](/aitor) and [Abraham](/abraham) we designed all the characters we wanted to implement. Zhib, Nerala and Master Omozra were designed with [Aitor](/aitor) and Hunar and Ranes with [Abraham](/abraham).<br/><br/>
          
          We created meaningful and rounded characters so that the audience could see why they were a certain way or why they had a certain set of skills. We tried to be inclusive while minding the hierarchy of Sietches and how the world worked. Our first concept included a different level for each character to be introduced in. In the end, however, we could only implement the first three with all of them as a unit.

        ### <u>Lighting Study</u>
          I was in charge of deciding how the lighting would affect the gameplay and other related features.<br/><br/>
          
          First I researched the type of main sources that could be found in Arrakis, such as Globglobes or window types. After that, deciding where everything would go and how would affect the gameplay for the first 4 designed levels was easy. In the end, we could not implement all of the levels and the lights, but it's worth mentioning, since I was also in charge of asking the programmers what kind of lights we would need.

        ### <u>GDD</u>
          My final main task was to keep up with the GDD.<br/><br/>
          
          Since everything was constantly changing and being adeapted to the resources we had, we decided to keep an updated verion of the GDD for each sprint. I would ask other designers what had changed that week and then upgrade the document.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>UI/UX Designer</u>
          I was in charge as well  of designing one of the first iterations of the UI and UX. It was used for a while before changing it to the way it is now. I would like to also showcase the UML diagram I created for the main menu and the pause menu. In this case, I also created a temporary logo.

        ### <u>Concept Art</u>
          I worked with artists to create the concept art for Nerala, Zhib and Master Omozra.

        ### <u>Enemies</u>
          I researched and proposed the first iteration of enemies, which included the Sardaukar and the Harkonnen.

        ### <u>Storyline proposition</u>
          As an extra task, I wrote the story we first wanted to create, which was not lineal and included different possibilities. Altough it was our goal, due to the lack of resources it was finally discarded.

        ### <u>Blockout and level implementation</u>
          I built the blockout of the third level, which wasn't implemented in the end. I was also in charge of implementing the tutorial level with the engine. I also did some 3d props for some other blockouts.

    # Projects
      In this section you will be able to find some projects I worked on in the past few years.
      For more projects you can access my [CV website](https://needlesslord.wordpress.com/).

      ## Project I: Fatal Fury (Invicta Studios)
        As a team of 4 we had to recreate the arcadde game Fatal Fury. Looking back, I can see how much I've learned and grown. [Here](https://github.com/nurialp12/INVICTA_Project1/wiki/Design) you can find the GitHub repository.
    
      ## Project II: PaintWars (Braindead Studios)
        As a team of 6 we had to create from scratch a RTS game. We developed PaintWars, which revolved around returning the stolen colours to a monochromatic world. As the lead, we had many setbacks during the development phase and we weren't realistic about our goals. [Here](https://github.com/Needlesslord/PaintWars_by_BrainDeadStudios) you can find the GitHub repository. In this project I learned HTML.

      ## Design: Guacamole Mix
        As a team of 3 we created a card game called Guacamole Mix, where every game you had recipe and you needed to get the ingredients. To this day it is one of my favourite works, although I rekon it needs polishing.

      ## Development: Ninja Frog (Nuto Studios)
        Tomás Carreras and I worked in a small platform game with two levels. We coded everything ourselves with C++ and I was in charge of the level design using Tiled. [Here](https://github.com/Needlesslord/Platformer_GD) you can see the project.

      ## Concept Art: La botica de Yeiih
        We had to create a novel with three different characters and build them from scratch. Mine was called {"La botica de Yeiih"}(https://needlesslord.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/244566_lamonja_nuria_dosier_arte_conceptual.pdf).

      ## Narrative: The drought
        As a team of 3 we created a card game called Guacamole Mix, where every game you had recipe and you needed to get the ingredients. To this day it is one of my favourite works, although I rekon it needs polishing.
