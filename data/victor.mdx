      ## About Me
        As far back as I can remember, video games have always been a part of my life. I remember those afternoons playing with my Nintendo DS when I was just 6 years old. Growing up
        together with this industry has created a link between it and me that lead to studying the bachelor's Degree in Video Game Design and Development. However, after all these years thinking about what I wanted to be my final destination, I found out that in reality, I am an animation enthusiast.

        Since I was young, animation films and videos have been my favourite content without any doubt. I always had the doubt of how people could make those characters look that real. When I started studying how to animate different characters for our games or videos, I enjoyed it much more since you are able to create and express your imagination by giving motion to a static character. I would love to be remembered as a good animator, someone who created content for those kids that in a future, they will watch it again and they will be transported themselves to their young being.

        The subject of Project III has been one of the most exhausting subjects I've had in my life. The fact of having errors difficult to solve, having not much time to develop or just the intensity of the project has really hitten hard. However, thanks to it I learned new things such as different animation software and how to use it, different ways to create, how to use new editing software, etc. At the end, it has been a hard subject, but the reward we get from it, is going to give us wings for our futures.
      
      ## Hard Skills
        As an artist, I consider myself as a 2D and 3D animator and video editor. I have experience in creating animations for different characters and editing different videos. The software I'm more used to use and those I want to learn more about them are (I am not limited to learn about different software):
        - Maya
        - Toon Boom
        - Sony Vegas Pro
        - Adobe Premiere Pro
        - Adobe After Effects
        - Blender

      ## Soft Skills
        - Cooperation
        - Kindness
        - Good communication
        - Adaptation to change
        - Technology management
        - Motivation
        - Creativity

      ## Project Overview
        For this project, I have been one of the members of the Art department. Mainly, my job has been to create the concept arts of the characters, creating the animation reels, 
        being in charge of the cutscenes production and creating the trailer of the game.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Concept Arts</u>
          My first job in the project was to draw and create the different concept arts of our characters. Starting with Zhib, later with Nerala, Omozra and finally, Rabban.
          This job of creating the different concepts has helped me to improve my drawing skills and learn how to do a good concept art. Some examples of the concept arts:

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_concept_art_assassin.png" width={600} height={361}/>

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_concept_art_wormtrainer.png" width={600} height={410}/>

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_concept_art_boss.png" width={600} height={404}/>

        ### <u>Animation Reels</u>
          The main part of my job has been creating the animation reels of nearly all the character in the game, from the characters controlled by the user to the different enemies.
          For the reels, we used different software such as Mixamo for common animations and Maya for the personalized ones. My objective since the beginning of the project was to 
          get better in the animation section, since I want to focus on that in my future professional career. Some examples of the animation reels made:

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_nerala_reel.gif" width={432} height={452}/>

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_omozra_reel.gif" width={394} height={332}/>
          
          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_worm_reel.gif" width={546} height={410}/>

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_harkonnen_reel.gif" width={438} height={398}/>

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_sardaukar_reel.gif" width={466} height={446}/>

        ### <u>Cutscene Production</u>
          Also, I was in charge of the cutscene production. My function was to develop some cutscenes and organize the different members of the cutscene production, [Marti Davicino](/martid) and
          [Carles López](/carles). For this part, we used different software such as Photoshop or Blender, as we created the cutscenes alternating between matte paintings and renders.
          Some examples of my work:

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_cutscene_menu.png" width={600} height={338}/>

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_cutscene_1.png" width={600} height={338}/>

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_cutscene_2.png" width={600} height={338}/>

          <Image src="/contents/screenshots/victor_cutscene_3.png" width={600} height={338}/>

        ### <u>Trailer</u>
          As my last main task, I was in charge of the game trailer. I was the director of the trailer, managing from the storyboard to the editing part. The software used for it
          has been Adobe Premiere Pro. [Here](/game) is the final result.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Particle & Effects Document</u>
          I created the document for the particles and effects of the game. My job was to search different particles that could fit in the game, specify where they had to appear and
          adding some references of them.
        
        ### <u>Character Optimization</u>
          Since I worked with the animations of the characters, some of them needed some optimization in order to create a much better result.
