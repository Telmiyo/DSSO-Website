      ## About Me
        For as long as I can remember video games have been part of my life. Those Arcade machines with 
        flickering lights, those PS2 controllers that I broke, Days filled with smiles and laughter...
        Videogames were always there for me, and when I finished high school I decided to leave Madrid and 
        start my adventure in Barcelona studying what I have and will always love.
        <br/>
        I realized soon after that playing and developing videogames are two completely different things,
        but what I did not spect is that all those years of experience led to an even bigger feeling of 
        passion and realization after finishing each project. I found a place where I could allow me to 
        express myself freely and with wonderful people with the same concerns and goals as me.
        <br/>
        After going through all the aspects of developing a videogame, an even deeper and almost forgotten
        desire to narrate stories and create experiences lead me to immerse myself in videogame design. 
        Creating worlds, characters, magic systems, legendary weapons, and many more exciting things set on track
        what I plan to do in the future. And that is to make that old Aitor proud and Design the most amazing
        games.

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        In this project my main role was to create a narrative for our game based on the Dune franchise.
        For this I researched Dune, created narrative iterations and worked with my colleages to create 
        the game's characters.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Narrative</u>
          As the main source of information for the design team about Dune, I created the main storyline
          that the game follows and framed it inside Dune's universe. The most important task that I carried
          out was to be true to the original story and universe while giving it our own twist. This created
          a side story that fits perfectly Dune's storyline and allowed the design team to be as inventive as
          we wanted.

        ### <u>Character Design</u>
          Me and [Nuria Lamonja](/Nuria) created the first iteration of the characters of Dune: Special Spice
          Ops. We worked together to create appealing and charismatic characters that as of now protagonize
          the story.

        ### <u>Unity Port</u>
          I worked together with [Eduard Minguell](/Eduard) to create a unity version of our game in order to 
          start the playtesting of our game. It is a prototype that conveis all the design team's decisions 
          and helped us to have a head start in the implementation proccess.          

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Similar Game analysis</u>
          [Nuria Lamonja](/Nuria) and me made a research about similar Rtts in order to create a better final 
          product.

        ### <u>Transition screens design</u>
          I came up with the first iteration of the concepts of the transition screen and the menues that 
          are found there.        

        ### <u>Cutscenes storyboards</u>
          Together with [Abraham Diaz](/Abraham) we created the storyboards for the cutscenes of the game. 

        ### <u>Implementation and playtesting</u>
          For the last steps of the development I worked with the rest of Design, programming and Art in the
          implementation of final values of game and the following playtesting.

     # Projects
        Throughout the years in my bachelor's degree I worked with my colleagues in the developing of the following
        projects.

          ## UnderEvil
            UnderEvil is a 2D RPG game that was developed by FM studios, formed by a group of seven students
            of the degree for Project II (CITM UPC). In this project we had the chance to work as a team and create
            a working RPG game almost from scratch based on SDL.

          ## CITM to the Moon
            CITM to the Moon is a 2D physics game about a small spaceship that has to arrive to the moon. It was
            developed by a small group of students for Physics II

          ## Pang replica
            For the Project I a group of srudents and me created a replica of the classic arcade game
            Pang in C and C++ with SDL 
            [(Repo)](https://github.com/MartiDavicino/Project_UPC)
