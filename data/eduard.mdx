many essential skills to benefit my personal development. "

      ## About Me
        I have always been a person interested on how things work related to one another, system behaviours and logical analysis. That 
        passion transferred to my love for video games led to me being interested in this sector since little. During the years I had 
        few chances to fully involve myself in the industry but the few experiences I had woke up my love for programming and 
        design. From there I did some exploration and developed few but surprisingly good small projects in my opinion for my level 
        at that time.<br/>

        It wasn't until starting the degree that I really started to dig into the sector and develop my skills. As said before I 
        enjoyed both programming and design and this project allowed me to polish and learn design aspects while also being able to 
        program and improve my code.<br/>

        I consider myself a hard working person that tries to polish everything as much as I can. During work I like the process of 
        thinking about all the aspects that may be influenced by my currrent actions, so I would define myself as really meticulous. 
        Influenced by this I think also comes my facility to synthesize problems.

    # Contribution
      ## Project Overview
        During the development of the game I had been assigned the role of *Designer*. Mainly my job has been focused on mechanics, 
        behaviours and level design. As the project kept developing I have also been assisting in many aspects of the game 
        apart from my main tasks and gained a strong base knowledge that led to me being more involved in overall supervision and polish.

      ## Main Tasks
        ### <u>Character Behaviours</u>
          I was in charge of developing and concising all the different behaviours that characters could do on our game. 
          This involved defining the actions, the abilities and the interaction of it all according to the enemies. Before developing 
          any of it I did a study on the same genre top games such as ***Shadow Tactics*** or ***Commandos***. 

        ### <u>Level Design: Rabban's Palace</u>
          After some approaches to this level, my job was to merge it all into the final level and design what would be the final level 
          of the game, where the player encounters Rabban. I did some research on level design beforehand to develop a basic workflow that 
          would make things easier when designing the final level.

          #### References
          Analyze the previous approaches to get their feeling and use it in the development of the final level. Decide approaches on 
          target level length, objectives and introduced enemies or mechanics.

          #### Bubble Diagram and Level Design
          Develop a bubble diagram to visualize the overall feeling of the areas, get a better understanding of the objectives and areas 
          connections and overall give a great base when starting to do the final precise design. Level Design got done after that and 
          gave many options to the player as many aspects of the gameplay where kept in mind during the process.

         ### <u>Unity Clone for Playtesting</u>
          As the development of the game was advancing, due to some difficulties on the engine's progress our work got slowed down. We 
          were getting near the part of playtesting and we wouldn't be able to do it at the current situation. That's why me and my 
          colleague [Aitor Álvarez](/aitor) were assigned to develop a replica of the gameplay idea that we had developed in order 
          to be able to start the playtesting. This clone added all base interactions and ended up being a great tool for playtesting and 
          deciding values, apart from making things visible and helping in the communication with the Programming Department.

        ### <u>SFX Implementation</u>
          I was in charge of implementing all the sound effects of the game. My job consisted in getting all effects and normalize 
          them before adding them to the engine. Once that was done I had to implement their calls in the code.

      ## Secondary Tasks
        ### <u>Blockout Iterations</u>
          I was in charge of iterating over the blockouts for the First Level and on one of the first approaches to 
          the later reworked Rabban's Palace. Iterating meant making changes in the design according to gameplay and approximating 
          assets to give the Artist Department a better feel of the level.

        ### <u>Playtesting</u>
          In the last part of the project almost the entirety of the Designer Department were in charge of playtesting. This meant 
          iterating and deciding values or major changes like gameplay mechanics or level design changes.

        ### <u>Coordination</u>
          My personal relationship with one of my colleagues, [Oscar Cuatrecasas](/oscar), gave me the possibility to be more in 
          touch with the Programming Department. As him being one of the main programmers we've been able to address major problems and get a better 
          vision on the overall development.

     # Projects
        In this section you will be able to see some of the projects I worked in during the last years.

          ## Dune: Special Spice Ops (Unity Copy)
            This is our game's clone made with the help of my already mentioned colleague [Aitor Álvarez](/aitor). I'm very proud of 
            our work due to its complexity for the relative small time that we had to develop it.

          ## Virtual Guy
            A simple platformer developed for our second year of studies for the Game Development 1 subject. It was developed by [Oscar Cuatrecasas](/oscar), 
            [Martí Davicino](/martid) and of course me.

          ## Pengo
            I would like to highlight this project as it was the first great project that we worked in groups and I got so much learning out of it. 
            Our goal was to replicate the already existing video game ***Pengo***. This was developed by [Telmo Beroiz](/telmo), [Andrés Sánchez](/andres), 
            [Oscar Cuatrecasas](/oscar) and of course me.
